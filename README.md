# PyTorch

## Chapter 1 : Introduction
  It provided the basics details about the nanodegree and the profile of various instructors

## Chapter 2 : Introduction to Neural Networks
  In this lesson, i learnt solid foundations on deep learning and neural networks. Starting with the perceptron model.
  It also had me implement gradient descent and backpropagation in Python without using any fancy library and just Numpy
  List of topics covered are :  
    1. Basics of neaural nets  
    2. Perceptron model  
    3. Linear and higher boundary  
    4. Perceptron algorithm  
    5. Error functions - logloss  
    6. Softmax and One-Hot encoding  
    7. Maximum Likelihood Estimation  
    8. Cross Entropy  
    9. Gradient Descent , Learning rate and momentum  
    10. Forward and Backward progation  
    11. Overfitting and Underfitting  
    12. Regularization  
    13. Batch vs Stochastic gradient descent.  
    
## Chapter 3 : Idea behind development of PyTorch
  Interview session with Soumith Chintala , his experience with deep learing and the need for a framework like PyTorch.
  
## Chapter 4 : Introduction to PyTorch
  From the basic creation of torch tensors to Transfer Learning and traing models using CUDA  
  List of topics covered are :  
    1. Creation and basic operation on Torch tensors  
    2. Building a single layerd neural net without using torch.nn module  
    3. Building a deep neural net without using torch.nn module and training on MNIST  
    4. Building a sequential model and training on Fashion MNIST  
    5. Saving and Loading a model  
    6. Regularization - dropouts  
    7. Transfer Learning - DenseNet and ResNet
